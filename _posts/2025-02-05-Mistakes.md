## Common mistakes

While I was solving this problem, I found out myself making some stupid mistakes:

- Wrong return value:

```cpp
else {
    return {0, -1}; // should be {-1, 0}
}
```

- Wrong while statement:

```cpp
while (i < n*n+1) { // should be n*n
    // ...
}
```

Mistakes do matter. Sometimes I had to waste 30 minutes finding out that a single typo I made or false condition statement was the main problem.

To prevent this:

- Always test a block of code before running the entire program.
- Be aware of iteration statements.
- Don't change variable names frequently.

## Write down all expected outputs

```cpp
// Solution 1 (WRONG)
class Solution {
    public:
        void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
            reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
            int N = nums.size();

            int smallK = k % nums.size();

            for (int i = 0; i < smallK; i++) {
                swap(nums[i], nums[smallK-i-1]);
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < N-smallK; i++) {
                swap(nums[smallK+i], nums[N-1-i]);
            }
        }
    };
```

If given `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3`, this code outputs `[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]`. What is wrong with the code?

Never trust your own code. Test your code by writing expected outputs for every step in for loop:

```
// nums = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, k = 3
// reversed
nums = {7,6,5,4,3,2,1}

// for (int i = 0; i < smallK; i++) { // smallK = 3
i = 0 : nums = {5,6,7,4,3,2,1}
i = 1 : nums = {5,6,7,4,3,2,1}
i = 2 : nums = {7,6,5,4,3,2,1}

-> Now we know what's wrong.

```

By writing outputs in each iteration step, we found out that it is swapping elements that have been swapped correctly once again.

The correct solution is:

```cpp
// Solution 2 (CORRECT)
class Solution {
    public:
        void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
            reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
            int N = nums.size();

            int smallK = k % nums.size();

            for (int i = 0; i < smallK/2; i++) {
                swap(nums[i], nums[smallK-i-1]);
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < (N-smallK)/2; i++) {
                swap(nums[smallK+i], nums[N-1-i]);
            }
        }
    };
```
