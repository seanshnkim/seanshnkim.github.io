## Spiral Matrix II

While I was solving this problem, I found out myself making some stupid mistakes:


 - Wrong return value:
```cpp
else {
    return {0, -1}; // should be {-1, 0}
}
```

- Wrong while statement:

```cpp
while (i < n*n+1) { // should be n*n
    // ...
}
```

Mistakes do matter. Sometimes I had to waste 30 minutes finding out that a single typo I made or false condition statement was the main problem.

To prevent this, I should:

- Always test a block of code before running the entire program.
- Be aware of iteration statements.
- Don't change variable names frequently.
