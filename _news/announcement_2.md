Last Saturday, I participated in a hackathon organized by Contech Alliance and advanced to the final round!

My team project was **\<Customizing Tool for Construction Company's Report\>**.
You can check out our [demo website](https://illustrious-dango-187d65.netlify.app).

It was a great opportunity to gain insights from other participants as well as to develop my problem solving skills.

Here is a post of the [event](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/contechalliance_what-an-incredible-hackathon-build-day-activity-7289990603130454016-4Os1) from Contech Alliance.
