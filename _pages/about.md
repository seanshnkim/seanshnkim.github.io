Welcome to my humble corner of the web!

Since Fall 2024, I've been pursuing my master's degree in Computer Engineering in the United States.
I wanted to share what I learn and code every day in this space.

I believe that writing is a surprisingly effective method of learning. Through writing, I can refine and hone the concepts I've learned. The act of committing to write also motivates myself to start studying new topics.

I previously worked as a ML engineer, but now I am aiming to transition my career towards embedded systems & firmware.
My interests in the field range from TinyML, MLOps to FreeRTOS, IoT, robotics and low-level programming.
