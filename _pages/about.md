Welcome to my humble corner of the web!

In the fall of 2024, I began my master's program in the United States. I felt it was necessary to create this space to showcase myself other than a simple resume.

I believe that writing is a surprisingly effective method of learning. Through writing, I can refine and hone the concepts I've learned. The act of committing to write also motivates myself to start studying new topics.

I am interested in embedded systems, IoT, operating systems, robotics and AI.
