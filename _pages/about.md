Hello, and welcome to my new blog!

### Why I started this blog
In the fall of 2024 I began my master's program in the US. Here, I felt the need to showcase myself. A resume is not enough, and Github only displays code. So you will read about my thoughts and motivations deep inside the code I have written, as a student aspiring to be an engineer.

Another reason: writing is the most effective method of learning. I can refine and hone and the concepts I learned through writing. The act of committing to write also becomes a powerful motivation to start studying a new topic.

Last but not least, writing is fun. It is very challenging, yet it is the easiest way for me to dive into a joyful state of 'flow'.

### Topics I will cover
I will mainly focus on Embedded Systems, IoT, and FreeRTOS. These are the areas I find most interesting (and also relevant to jobs I am seeking - embedded software engineer!). However, I also plan to write about ML/AI, which were my specialties, and the courses I'm taking at school.

### Contacts
I check the blog at least once a week. But for quicker replies, please email me or send me a Linkedin message.
